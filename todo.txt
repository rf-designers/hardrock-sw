1) extra noise on RX when passing through the amp
2) extra hardware protection to kill the power to the Qs when something goes wrong



    P.1 when amp enters power saving, it won't wake up whenever the externally connected transceiver sends data on serial and it needs to
    S.1 -

--------------------------------------

    P.2. we want additional hardware additional protection to cut off the Q vcc when anything goes wrong.

    P.2.1: defining what can "go wrong"
        - RFL too high
        - FWD too high
        - DC power (U*I) too high
    P.2.2: what sensors data we have available

        - the power board has an LTC2945M chip on it which gives power to the finals (https://eu.mouser.com/datasheet/2/609/ltc2945-2956028.pdf)
        - it can have limits set and alerts triggered when limits exceeded
        - the ~ALERT of the chip is pulled up to +5V and routed from the power board to the control board and to the LPF board
        - additionally, ~ALERT is used to a 74LVC2G00DP (Power board's U202,  https://ro.mouser.com/datasheet/2/916/74LVC2G00-1545549.pdf) which is configured as a latch; ~ALERT disables the power to the final transistors and ~RESET enables the power to the final transistors.
        - the ~RESET pulse comes from the arduino mega, pin D23 (look for RESET_PULSE macro being called)

        - current and voltage:
            - the amplifier reads current and voltage at certain intervals and then triggers a trip if need be
            - TODO: the chip can have thresholds set for current, voltage and power readings
                    we should set those from the software and we will have an ~ALERT triggered when the limits are passed
                    the SW can find out about this condition by routing ~TRIP to an interrupt pin and then read the fault condition from the chip in order to update the display


        - FWD, RFL voltages:
            - they come as voltages from the LPF board
            - A12 reads FWD_DET
            - A13 reads RFL_DET
            - A15 reads DRV_PWR
            - the reading happens on timerIsr()
            - inside main loop(), the read and averaged data is used to decide whether an alert needs to be triggered
            - if an alert needs to be triggered, trip_set() is invoked, having as effect the cutting off of the Q power



    P.2.3: integration with software
        - Pins 2 and 3 labeled as RFL_TRIP and FWD_TRIP go from control board to LPF board but are unused
        - those pins are assigned to hardware external interrupts (2 -> PCINT0, 3 -> PCINT1)
    P.2.4: resetting the trip?




Ideas:

--------------------

Frederic: I would make 4 graphs + their printed value:
            FWD, RFL, DC-POWER, DRV
            And also indicate the band.
            The DC I and DC U, can be shown in a table elsewhere, the DC Power is more important and is U*I
Adrian: how often to read the data from sensors?
Frederic: Quite often, say 10/second, or less if 10 is too much.

--------------------

Adrian: I need to do yet another hw improvement
            the noise is gone when I use a sleep mode which powers off pretty much everything
            I can wake up on touch screen presses and on wdt but can't wake up on Serial/Serial2/Serial3 traffic
            so I'm thinking of creating a pin dedicated to wake up
            I will need an external detector for the serial ports to wake up the thing

Adrian: also thought about the little microcontroller solution for relaying the serial traffic and waking up the arduino
        there are some things to fix: the speed and polarity of the second serial may vary
        as it comes from different transceivers
        what we know is that it will be a 0-5V signal
        one possible solution is to enable I2C on this small mcu  and be told what to expect
        (stm32l010c6)
Frédéric: Yes, I2C is a good idea. Is the new processor capable to invert the signal? Or would you need an exor again.
Adrian: it can do
        other solution is to simply mirror all pin changes
        blindly
        and have the xor do its job as before
        but then I would need them delayed a bit
